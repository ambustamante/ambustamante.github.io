I am an Early Stage Researcher in the [DComm Project](http://www.dcomm.eu) a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network. DComm is an interdisciplinary project which aims to make significant progress in understanding deictic communication. I am hosted in the [University of Münster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics/en/institute/staff/index.php/246/Samuel_Navas_Medrano). My research line takes as a topic Deitic Communication and Mobile Devices. Mobile systems provide many means to relay information to a distant partner but remote communication is still limited compared to face-to-face interaction. Deictic communication and pointing in particular are challenging when two parties communicate across distances. My research aims to address the gap in remote communication of spatial information by understanding, precisely, how population behave when communicating spatial information in both collocated and remote but technology mediated scenarios.


My name is Inigo Montoya. I have the following qualities:

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
